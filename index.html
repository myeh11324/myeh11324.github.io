        <font color='purple'>hello world</font>, i'm milly. i started my career as an electrical engineer in michigan working in power 
        systems, but found my  <font color='purple'>passion in code</font>. i love learning, solving problems, building things and
        <span id='line-through'>seeing</span> <font color=purple>making</font> creative ideas come to fruition. five months ago, i moved to nyc to 
        enroll in a dev bootcamp and fell in love with the city. i completed the immersive program at fullstack academy 
        recently and am seeking a  <font color='purple'>software engineering position</font>. please reach out if you'd like to chat!<br /><br />

        this was my first big project in the realm of web dev. it was a  <font color='purple'>fullstack eCommerce app</font> built 
        using node, express, react/redux, and postgreSQL/sequelize. a lot of interesting logic went into
        building this application, particularly concerning users and their shopping carts. i had tons of 
        fun working on this - i learned so much about structuring <font color='purple'>react</font> components and effectively using 
        <font color='purple'>redux</font> to manage state, making <font color='purple'>RESTful api routes</font>, 
        team collaboration using the <font color='purple'>agile/scrum</font> methodology and following proper git workflow, the list goes on. <br /><br /><br />

        i started this project during a four-day hackathon. the idea was to grab a user's current 
        weather data and generate song recommendations based on the mood that matches the weather
        using <font color='purple'>react, node.js, and the spotify api</font>. admittedly, the spotify api gave me a massive
        headache in the beginning - i found the documentation quite confusing to navigate. after spending additional
        time and research on understanding the authentication/authorization process, i was able to get past this
        and make my api calls successfully. i recently jumped back on this project and am pleased with its progress.
        i plan to continue working on fine<span class='italicize'>tuning</span> ;) some of the small details.
        music is one of my life's greatest joys and i've really enjoyed the experience of building a <font color=purple>music-themed app</font>. <br /><br /><br />

        this was the capstone project my team and i built during our time at fullstack. our idea
        started as a VR language-learning game (which quickly got shot down by our instructor)
        and evolved into a <font color='purple'>multi-platform language-learning application</font> consisting of a <font color='purple'>chrome extension</font>
        written in vanilla js and jquery, data storage/management using firebase, and a <font color='purple'>mobile application</font> 
        built with react native/expo/redux. i had an incredible time working on this. i loved the language learning 
        concept from the get-go and i was blessed with fantastic teammates. this is something that i would 
        absolutely download and use. what's duolingo?  <br /><br /><br />
