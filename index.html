        <font color='purple'>hello world, i'm milly.</font> i started my career as an electrical engineer in michigan working in power 
        systems, but found my  <font color='purple'>passion in code</font>. i love learning, solving problems, building things and
        <span id='line-through'>seeing</span> making creative ideas come to fruition. five months ago, i moved to nyc to 
        enroll in a dev bootcamp and fell in love with the city. i completed the immersive program at fullstack academy 
        recently and am seeking a  <font color='purple'>software engineering position</font>. please reach out if you'd like to chat!

        this was my first big project in the realm of web dev. it was a  <font color='purple'>fullstack eCommerce app</font> built 
        using node, express, react/redux, and postgreSQL/sequelize. a lot of interesting logic went into
        building this application, particularly concerning users and their shopping carts. i had a lot of 
        fun working on this - sure it's not the cleanest code <span id='italicize'>ever</span>, but i learned a lot about structuring 
        <font color='purple'>react</font> components and effectively using <font color='purple'>redux</font> to manage state, making <font color='purple'>RESTful api routes</font>, 
        team collaboration using the  <font color='purple'>agile/scrum</font> methodology and following proper git workflow, the list goes on. <br /><br /><br />

        i started this project during a four-day hackathon. the idea was to grab a user's current 
        weather data and generate song recommendations based on the mood that matches the weather
        using  <font color='purple'>react, node.js, and the spotify api</font>. admittedly, the spotify api gave me a massive
        headache in the beginning - i found the  documentation to be quite confusing to navigate. after spending additional
        time and research to understand the  <font color='purple'>authentication/authorization</font> process, i was able to get past this
        and make my api calls successfuly. i recently jumped back on this project and am pleased by its progress. 
        next up, i'd like to make some adjustments to the mood-matching feature and add styling.
        music is one of my life's greatest joys and i really enjoyed the experience of building a music-themed app. <br /><br /><br />

        this was the capstone project my team and i built during our time at fullstack. our idea
        started as a VR language-learning game (which quickly got shot down by our instructor)
        and evolved into a  <font color='purple'>language-learning platform</font> consisting of a google chrome extension
        written in vanilla js and jquery, data storage/management using firebase, and a mobile application 
        built with react native/redux. i had an incredible time working on this. i loved the language learning 
        concept from the get-go and i was blessed with fantastic teammates. this is something that i would 
        absolutely download and use. what's duolingo?  <br /><br />
